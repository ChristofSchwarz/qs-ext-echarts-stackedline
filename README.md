# Apache echarts implementation for Qlik Sense

This extension creates a stacked line chart like this from two dimensions and a measure
 - Dim 1) The x-axis dimension (typically a time dimension like a month)
 - Dim 2) The y-axis dimension: the data series by which the lines will be stacked
 - Measure 1) The value 
 - Optional Measure 2) a color code for the stack.

All labels and colors can be defined in the extension.
